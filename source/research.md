  Algotithm transparency is essential for machine learning tasks in order to trust a model. Two recommend paper [LIME](http://www.kdd.org/kdd2016/papers/files/rfp0573-ribeiroA.pdf) and [QII](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~zick/papers/transparency.oakland16.pdf).

  EEG gathered from different subjects vary significantly. Transfer learning is a proper method to promote the accuracy of model on different domains.
